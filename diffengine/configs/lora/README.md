[LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)

## Abstract

An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA.

## Inference with diffusers

Once you have trained a model, specify the path to the saved model and utilize it for inference using the `diffusers.pipeline` module.

```py
from pathlib import Path

import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline, AutoencoderKL
from peft import PeftModel

checkpoint = Path('work_dirs/stable_diffusion_xl_lora_pokemon_blip/step20850')
prompt = 'yoda pokemon'

vae = AutoencoderKL.from_pretrained(
    'madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix',
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
)
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0', vae=vae, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to('cuda')
pipe.unet = PeftModel.from_pretrained(pipe.unet, checkpoint / "unet", adapter_name="default")

image = pipe(
    prompt,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
).images[0]
image.save('demo.png')
```
